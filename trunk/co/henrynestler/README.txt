We changed the naming from freetzlinux to speedlinux.
(To avoid mistakes because the name 'freetz-linux' is now in use by: Silent-Tears)

This Version is adjusted for the use with speed-to-fritz and speed.

X Applications:

1. Click start icon (speedlinux pinguin) on desktop, menu, ...   
	or use startup.bat found in your installation directory.
2. Wait until LINUX boot process is finished. 
		Use Console-NT (Donald duck icon), 
		or Console-FTLK (ying yung icon),
		watch the boot process and wait a bit.
	*	console-nt: paste with WinKey+V

3. Click any X Windows icon.
	(Xming window server is stated after startup.bat via settings.txt)
	Or type in: 'konsole' followed by Enter key in Console(NT) or Console (FTLK) 
	to bring up a X konsole.

4.	Login as normal user.

Type in: ./download_speed-to-fritz.sh followed by Enter key,
	to download  and start the latest speed-to-fritz version.

Type in: ./freetz.sh followed by Enter key, 
	to download and start freetz.

(Some updates and installations will run once as well, if the above skrits are invoked)

ATTENTION!
Make sure that you already have a physical LAN connection up running with a link to a router,
because there is a bug that blocks all activity if this is not the case (blue screen).

LAN connectivity:
You must rename your Windows physical LAN connection to 'LAN1'
if the install script could not do this.
You can disable the bridge connection to the Internet if you add a 
leading hash sign to the following line within settings.txt
eth2=ndis-bridge,"LAN1", -> #eth2=ndis-bridge,"LAN1",
This makes eth0 unusable with dhcp, and pings will not be possible.
(WLAN could also be used, but it must be bridged in your windows network settings.)
(pcap-bridge needs Win-Pcap installed, ndis-bridge is about the same but does not need Win-Pcap.)

On the LINUX system setup did make changes, in /etc/network/interfaces
eth0 is set to: dhcp
eth2 is set to: 192.168.178.10

* If you dont want to use all core CPUs,
disable the following line in startup.bat by adding the "::"
::set COLINUX_NO_CPU0_WORKAROUND=Y
(Some PC need this changed, to get coLinux working.) 
Maximum CPU usage is 50% even all core CPUs are in use.

Some changes since 05.05.2009 base.drv is now called base.vdi
This was done to be compatible to andLinux beta2 final

coLinux kernelversion is now 2.6.25.20, but dont worry 
coLinux kernel version must not be the same as the kernelversion 
usual usd on the system installed.
