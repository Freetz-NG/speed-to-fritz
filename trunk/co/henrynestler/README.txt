This Version is adjusted for the use with speed2freetz and freetz.
There is still a problem with setting passwords, so you must do the manually.

By invoking 'passwd' as root within the black FLTK window after start.
Default root password is 'root'
The new user is without password but you must assign a password!


LAN connectivity:

You can enable a bridge connection to the Internet if you remove the leading hash sign from  
the following line within andlinux/settings.txt
#eth2=ndis-bridge,"LAN1", -> eth2=ndis-bridge,"LAN1",

pcap-bridge needs Win-Pcap installed. ndis-bridge is about the same but does not need Win-Pcap.
You should update ubuntu and install pump by invoking the following line:
sudo apt-get -y update && sudo apt-get -y upgrade && sudo apt-get -y dist-upgrade && apt-get install pump

This will make eth0 usable with dhcp, and pings via LAN1 will be possible, but not via WLAN if not bridged inside windows.

In /etc/network/interfaces
eth0 is set to: dhcp
eth2 is set to: 192.168.178.10
You must rename your Windows physical LAN connection to 'LAN1' if the install script could not do it.
ATENTION!
If eth2 is enable by you, then make sure you already have a physical LAN connection up running with a link to the router, 
because there is a bug that blocks all activity if this is not the case.



X Applications:
1.
Xming window server is usually stated via auto start!
2. 
Click start icon on desktop.
3.
Click any X Windows icon.

IMPORTANT:
don't start the X Windows to fast after start, all needs some time to settle!

Resizing Images takes 15 minutes or much longer depending on the size.
