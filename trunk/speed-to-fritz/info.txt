1. Calling lists can't be transferred to some DECT Handsets, Only Sinus 500i will store information on the handsets.
   Only Swissvoice Eurit 547/557/567/577. Handsets will give the complete functionality.
    

For more information please read the corresponding threads at the IP Forum.
For each type of router there is a active thread, there you can post problems, and hopefully find answers.
