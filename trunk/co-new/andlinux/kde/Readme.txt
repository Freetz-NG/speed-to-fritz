Here you have to place the base.vdi and swap.vdi files, which cannot be kept in the
SVN due to it's size of several gigabytes. The easiest way to obtain them, is to
install the latest andLinux release and copy them from the "Drives" subfolder of the
installation folder _BEFORE_ Windows is restarted (they can't be copied while in use
and they will be changed during the first boot).
