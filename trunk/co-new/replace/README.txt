ATTENTION!

Make sure that you already have a physical LAN connection up running with a link
to a router or the internet.

LAN connectivity:
If your Windows physical LAN connection to the internet is not named 'LAN1'
then you must rename your Windows physical connection 'LAN1'
or you may change the name in settings.txt.
You can disable the bridge connection to the Internet if you add a 
leading hash sign to the following line within [Installdir]\settings.txt
eth2=ndis-bridge,"LAN1", -> #eth2=ndis-bridge,"LAN1",
(pcap-bridge needs Win-Pcap installed, ndis-bridge is about the same but does not 
need Win-Pcap, and is much faster.)
Read documetation for mor info on the subject.

* If you dont want to use 2nd CPU core,
disable the following line in startup.bat by adding the "::"
::set COLINUX_NO_CPU0_WORKAROUND=Y
(Some PC need this changed, to get coLinux working.) 
Maximum CPU usage is 50%, even all core CPUs are in use.

Changes since 05.05.2009:
base.drv is now called base.vdi
This was done to be compatible to andLinux beta2 final
